# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP

The goal of this project was to investigate if there is a significant relationship between a nation's economy and its citizens' life expectancy. The model aimed to reveal if life expectancy and GDP increased over time, and the distribution of the data.

A csv file was given, ('all_data.csv'), with GDP data from the World Bank national accounts and OECD National Accounts data files. The life expectancy data was sourced from the World Health Organization.
